# script-based-shopify-scraper


I build this on very a short deadline as part of my freelancing profect, the code for this is written in two days without any planning or much great attention, however the designed implementation are working as per expectations.
The purpose of this app is to fetch all publicly accesible products data from a particular shopify store into a csv file.
